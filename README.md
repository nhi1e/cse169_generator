**AI Use**

ChatGPT assisted with:

- Refactoring the original single-file sketch into modular files (`draw.js`, `object.js`, `fish.js`, etc.) for clarity and maintainability.
- Debugging rendering issues
- Guidance for implementing specific techniques to achieve painting like effect like water effects and layering techniques
- Designing functions `drawPetalStroke()`, `drawLilyFlower()`, `drawFish()` to emulate painterly brush strokes and natural variation. Designing helper functions for converting colors/choosing palettes
- Adding interactivity including the feature for seed sharing and image export
